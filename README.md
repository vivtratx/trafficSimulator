This Traffic Simulation Project is a data structures-focused simulation written in C that models cars navigating a city's road network. The network is represented as a directed graph, where vertices denote intersections and edges represent one-way roads of specified lengths. Each road also includes a traffic light with configurable green and red cycles, influencing whether cars can pass through an intersection at a given time step.

Cars in the simulation always travel along the shortest path to their destination, determined using a helper function called `getNextOnShortestPath`, which likely implements a graph traversal algorithm such as Dijkstra’s. Roads maintain cars in arrays, respecting a strict **FIFO order**—cars cannot pass others. Car movement is governed by a set of simulation steps including checking for traffic light status, availability of space on the next road, and resolving accidents.

Events such as adding new cars or handling road accidents are handled using a **priority queue** ordered by time step. When cars are added to roads or accidents occur, the relevant events are enqueued and later executed in the correct order. During each simulation step, cars attempt to move forward in their lane, and the simulation engine updates road states and prints results.

At the end of the simulation, the program reports both the **average and maximum number of steps** taken by cars to reach their destination, providing a metric to evaluate road network efficiency. This project effectively integrates core data structures like graphs, arrays, and priority queues, while implementing real-world logic such as traffic flow and event handling to evaluate a transportation system.
